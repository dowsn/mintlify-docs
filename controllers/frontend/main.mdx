description: 'Main controller for the frontend functionality'

## Overview

The `Frontend` class is the main controller for handling frontend functionality in the application. It extends the `MY_Controller` class and incorporates various traits to organize and modularize its functionality.

## Class Definition

```php
class Frontend extends MY_Controller
```

## Constructor

The constructor initializes the controller and sets up necessary components.

```php
function __construct()
```

### Actions performed in the constructor:

1. Calls the parent constructor
2. Detects the user's device
3. Loads the `besc_helper` helper
4. Loads the `form_validation` library
5. Loads the Braintree PHP library (version 5.0.0)
6. Loads the `cookie` helper
7. Includes the FPDF library
8. Includes the FPDI library
9. Includes the PasswordHash library

## Included Traits

The `Frontend` class uses the following traits to organize its functionality:

- `Helper_Frontend`
- `Pages_Frontend`
- `Detail_Load_Frontend`
- `Data_Frontend`
- `Format_Frontend`
- `Forms_Frontend`
- `User_Frontend`
- `Language_Frontend`

## Included Files

The following files are included at the beginning of the class:

1. `Helper_Frontend.php`
2. `Pages_Frontend.php`
3. `User_Frontend.php`
4. `Detail_Load_Frontend.php`
5. `Data_Frontend.php`
6. `Format_Frontend.php`
7. `Forms_Frontend.php`
8. `Language_Frontend.php`

These files are located in the `APPPATH . 'controllers/FRONTEND/'` directory.

<Note>
The code includes a commented-out line for setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. This suggests that Google Cloud services might be used in the application, but the line is currently inactive.
</Note>

## Security

The file begins with a security check to prevent direct script access:

```php
defined('BASEPATH') or exit('No direct script access allowed');
```

This ensures that the script can only be accessed through the proper CodeIgniter application flow.
