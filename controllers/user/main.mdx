## Overview

The `Users` class is a controller that extends the `Backend` class. It provides functionality for managing users in the backend system, including both admin users and frontend users. This class includes methods for listing users, resetting passwords, and handling user-related operations.

## Class Definition

```php
class Users extends Backend

## Constructor

The constructor initializes the class and loads the Content_model. It also checks if the current user is an admin, redirecting non-admin users.

<CodeGroup>
```php
function __construct()
{
    parent::__construct();
    $this->load->model('entities/Content_model', 'cm');
    if ($this->user->is_admin != 1) {
        redirect('');
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
