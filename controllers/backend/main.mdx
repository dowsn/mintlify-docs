## Custom Menu Handling

The `page()` method includes logic for setting up custom menus. Here's a detailed breakdown of this process:

### Custom Menu Generation

The controller retrieves and structures custom menu data using the following process:

1. Retrieves Lecker areas using `$this->bm->getLeckerAreas()`.
2. For each area, it retrieves associated menus using `$this->bm->getLeckerMenus($area_id)`.
3. For each menu, it retrieves submenus using `$this->bm->getLeckerSubmenus($menu_id)`.
4. The resulting structure is stored in `$data['custom_menus']` for use in the view.

<CodeGroup>
```php Custom Menu Structure
$lecker_menu_array = [
  {
    // Area properties
    menus: [
      {
        // Menu properties
        submenus: [
          {
            // Submenu properties
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
The custom menu generation relies on the existence of `lecker_areas`, `lecker_menus`, and `lecker_submenus` tables in the database.
</Note>

## File Upload Handling

The controller includes two methods for handling file uploads:

### upload_image()

Handles image file uploads.

<ResponseField name="Parameters" type="object">
  Expects POST data with:
  - filename: The original name of the file
  - uploadpath: The server path where the file should be uploaded
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Returns">
  JSON response with:
  - success: Boolean indicating if the upload was successful
  - path: The server path where the file was saved
  - filename: The new filename of the uploaded file
</ResponseField>

### upload_file()

Handles general file uploads.

<ResponseField name="Parameters" type="object">
  Expects POST data with:
  - filename: The original name of the file
  - uploadpath: The server path where the file should be uploaded
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Returns">
  JSON response with:
  - success: Boolean indicating if the upload was successful
  - path: The server path where the file was saved
  - filename: The filename of the uploaded file
</ResponseField>

<Note>
Both upload methods use the `move_uploaded_file()` PHP function to handle the actual file transfer.
</Note>

## Authentication Handling

The controller includes a method for checking user authentication status:

### checkLoggedin()

Checks if the user is currently logged in.

<ResponseField name="Returns">
  JSON response with:
  - success: Boolean indicating if the user is logged in
</ResponseField>

This method can be used for AJAX requests to verify user authentication status without reloading the page.

## Error Handling and Validation

Throughout the controller, there are several instances of error checking and validation:

1. Database table existence checks using `$this->tableExists()`.
2. Method existence checks using `$this->methodExists()`.
3. POST data validation using `$this->postPropertiesExist()`.

These checks help ensure that the necessary database structures and methods are in place before operations are performed, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

## Constants and Configuration

The controller references several constants that are likely defined in a configuration file:

- `BASEPATH`
- `DB_NAME`
- `NUMBER_OF_LANGUAGES`
- `MAIN_LANGUAGE`
- `IS_SHOP`
- `ITEMS_COLOR`
- `IMAGES_COLOR`
- `FILES_COLOR`

These constants appear to control various aspects of the application's behavior and appearance.

## Integration with External Libraries

The constructor loads several external libraries:

- FPDF
- FPDI
- PHPExcel

These libraries are likely used for PDF generation and Excel file manipulation, although the specific usage is not visible in the provided code snippet.

<Warning>
The use of external libraries may introduce dependencies and potential security risks. Ensure that these libraries are kept up-to-date and that their usage complies with your application's security requirements.
</Warning>

## Conclusion

The Backend controller serves as a central hub for various administrative and backend operations in the application. It handles user authentication, file management, custom menu generation, and various entity-specific operations. The controller makes extensive use of model methods for database operations and includes several utility methods for common tasks.

For a complete understanding of the system, it's crucial to review the associated models, views, and configuration files that interact with this controller.
