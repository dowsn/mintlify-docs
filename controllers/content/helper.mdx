## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to CodeIgniter's database and other utility functions.
- It assumes the existence of several constants (e.g., `TABLE_ENTITY_WITH_ARTICLE`, `ARTICLE_TYPES`, `NUMBER_OF_LANGUAGES`) which should be defined elsewhere in the application.
- The Google Analytics methods require proper setup of Google Analytics credentials and the Google Analytics Data API.

<Note>
The trait uses several properties and methods that should be defined in the class using this trait, such as `$this->user`, `$this->bc`, and various model methods.
</Note>

<Warning>
- The CSV import function (`csvToDb`) directly inserts data into the database without extensive validation. Ensure proper input sanitization is implemented when using this method.
- The Google Analytics methods require the `google/analytics-data` package and proper configuration of credentials.
- Some methods use direct file system operations which may require appropriate permissions in the production environment.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait effectively:
1. Include it in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required properties, methods, and constants are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Configure Google Analytics credentials properly if using analytics features.
4. Implement proper error handling and input validation, especially for CSV imports and file operations.
5. Adjust file paths and URL structures as needed for your specific application setup.
