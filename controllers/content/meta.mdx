## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to CodeIgniter's features and a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`).
- It assumes the existence of several model methods (e.g., `$this->cm->get_items_categories()`, `$this->cm->get_items()`).
- The trait uses authentication checks to ensure only admin users can access these settings.

<Note>
The trait uses several properties and methods that should be defined in the class using this trait, such as `$this->user`, `$this->groupName`, `$this->setTableName()`, etc.
</Note>

<Warning>
- Direct database operations are used in some methods. Implement proper input validation and error handling in production environments.
- File upload functionality is included for marquee images. Ensure proper security measures are in place for file uploads.
- The trait assumes specific database structures for menus, languages, and colors. Ensure your database schema matches these assumptions.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait effectively:
1. Include it in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required properties, methods, and libraries are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Adjust the CRUD configurations (columns, filters, etc.) to match your specific requirements for each content type.
4. Implement proper security measures, especially for file uploads and admin-only accessible methods.
5. Customize the language and color management to fit your application's internationalization and theming needs.
