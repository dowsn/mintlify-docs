title: 'Tags_Content Trait'
description: 'Trait for managing general and specific tags in a content management system'
---

The `Tags_Content` trait provides functionality for managing both general tags applicable across different content types and specific tags for particular content entities.

## Main Methods

### tags()

Manages general tags that can be applied across multiple content types.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - CRUD operations for general tags
  - Dynamically generates relations for all article types defined in ARTICLE_TYPES
  - Supports multilingual tag names (default and English)
</ResponseField>

### normal_tags()

Manages specific tags for a particular content type (in this case, "normal" content).

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - CRUD operations for specific tags
  - Relation management between tags and the specific content type
  - Supports multilingual tag names (default and English)
</ResponseField>

## Common Features

- Both methods use a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`) for database operations
- Access is restricted to admin users
- Each method sets up specific columns for listing and filtering data

## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to CodeIgniter's features and a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`).
- It assumes the existence of an `ARTICLE_TYPES` constant or configuration that defines different content types in the system.
- The trait uses authentication checks to ensure only admin users can access these settings.

<Note>
The `tags()` method dynamically generates relations for all article types defined in `ARTICLE_TYPES`. Ensure this constant or configuration is properly set up in your application.
</Note>

<Warning>
- Direct database operations are used in some methods. Implement proper input validation and error handling in production environments.
- The trait assumes specific database structures for tags and their relations. Ensure your database schema matches these assumptions.
- The `normal_tags()` method uses the function name to determine the specific tag type. Be cautious when renaming this method or create similar methods for other specific tag types.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait effectively:
1. Include it in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required properties, methods, and libraries are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Set up the necessary database tables and schemas for general tags and specific tag types.
4. Define your `ARTICLE_TYPES` constant or configuration to match your content structure.
5. Create additional methods similar to `normal_tags()` for other specific tag types you need to manage.
6. Implement proper security measures, especially for admin-only accessible methods.

## Key Components

### General Tags
- Supports multiple content type relations
- Dynamically generated based on `ARTICLE_TYPES`

### Specific Tags (e.g., normal_tags)
- Tailored to a particular content type
- Manages relations between tags and content items

Both components use CRUD operations to allow easy management through an admin interface.
