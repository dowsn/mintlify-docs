## Common Features

- All methods use a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`) for database operations
- Access is restricted to admin users
- Each method sets up specific columns for listing and filtering data

## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to CodeIgniter's features and a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`).
- It assumes the existence of a content model (`$this->cm`) with methods like `getAllProducts()`, `getCustomers()`, etc.
- The trait uses authentication checks to ensure only admin users can access these settings.

<Note>
The trait interacts with several database tables related to e-commerce functionality. Ensure your database schema includes these tables (prefixed with 's_' for shop-related tables).
</Note>

<Warning>
- Direct database operations are used in some methods. Implement proper input validation and error handling in production environments.
- The trait assumes specific database structures. Ensure your database schema matches these assumptions.
- Some fields use CKEditor for rich text input. Ensure proper sanitization of this input to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait effectively:
1. Include it in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required properties, methods, and libraries are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Set up the necessary database tables and schemas.
4. Implement the content model (`$this->cm`) with the required methods.
5. Customize the CRUD configurations (columns, filters, etc.) if needed to match your specific e-commerce requirements.
6. Implement proper security measures, especially for admin-only accessible methods.
