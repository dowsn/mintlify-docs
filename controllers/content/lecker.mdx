description: 'Trait for managing Lecker-specific content and settings in a content management system'
---

The `Lecker_Content` trait provides functionality for managing Lecker-specific content, including page settings, dashboard widgets, and Google Analytics data.

## Main Methods

### page_settings()

Manages global page settings for the CMS.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Controls OpenAI visibility
  - Sets the number of rows displayed per page
  - Uses CRUD operations for settings management
</ResponseField>

### google_analytics()

Displays Google Analytics data, specifically city-based analytics.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Calls `GA_Analytics_Cities()` method to fetch data
  - Renders the data in a specific view ('backend/g_analytics')
</ResponseField>

### lecker_dashboard()

Manages dashboard widgets for the Lecker CMS.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Allows configuration of widgets based on database tables
  - Includes ordering and color settings for widgets
  - Uses CRUD operations for widget management
</ResponseField>

## Utility Methods

The trait includes several utility methods for preparing select data, getting table names, and handling colors. These methods are used internally by the main methods.

## Key Features

- CRUD-based management for settings and widgets
- Integration with Google Analytics
- Color management for UI elements
- Dynamic table selection for dashboard widgets

## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to CodeIgniter's features and a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`).
- It assumes the existence of several model methods (e.g., `$this->getSelector()`, `$this->getPrettyName()`).
- The trait uses a custom approach to gather available tables by extracting method names from other traits.

<Note>
The trait uses several properties and methods that should be defined in the class using this trait, such as `$this->user`, `$this->GA_Analytics_Cities()`, etc.
</Note>

<Warning>
- The Google Analytics integration assumes the existence of a configured Google Analytics setup and appropriate credentials.
- Direct database operations are used in some methods. Implement proper input validation and error handling in production environments.
- The trait contains commented-out methods (`lecker_areas()`, `lecker_menus()`, `lecker_submenus()`) which might be intended for future use or represent deprecated functionality.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait effectively:
1. Include it in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required properties, methods, and libraries are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Configure Google Analytics integration if using the `google_analytics()` method.
4. Adjust the CRUD configurations (columns, filters, etc.) to match your specific requirements for settings and widgets.
5. Consider implementing or modifying the commented-out methods if additional functionality is needed.
6. Ensure proper security measures are in place, especially for admin-only accessible methods.
