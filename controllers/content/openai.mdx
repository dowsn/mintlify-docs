---

The `Openai_Content` trait provides functionality for managing various aspects of OpenAI integration within a content management system. It includes methods for handling chat logs, translations, language lines, inputs, languages, and prompts related to OpenAI interactions.

## Main Methods

### openai_chat_log()

Manages the OpenAI chat logs.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Displays chat topics, checked status, and creation time
  - Provides a link to view detailed chat logs
</ResponseField>

### openai_chats($id)

Displays detailed chat logs for a specific chat session.

<ResponseField name="Parameters">
  <ResponseField name="id" type="integer">
    The ID of the chat session
  </ResponseField>
</ResponseField>

### openai_question_translations()

Manages translations for OpenAI questions.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Links prompts to languages and their translations
</ResponseField>

### openai_langlines()

Manages language lines for OpenAI interactions.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Stores key-value pairs for different languages
</ResponseField>

### openai_inputs()

Manages input data for OpenAI prompts.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Stores topics and associated input text
</ResponseField>

### openai_languages()

Manages the list of languages supported in the OpenAI system.

### openai_prompts()

Manages OpenAI prompts.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Stores areas, topics, questions, user prompts, and system prompts
  - Tracks whether prompts are translated
</ResponseField>

## Common Features

- All methods use a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`) for database operations
- Access is restricted to admin users
- Each method sets up specific columns for listing and filtering data
- Custom buttons are added where necessary (e.g., to link to detailed chat logs)

## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to CodeIgniter's features and a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`).
- It assumes the existence of an OpenAI model (`$this->om`) with methods like `getOpenaiPrompts()`, `getOpenaiLanguages()`, etc.
- The trait uses authentication checks to ensure only admin users can access these settings.

<Note>
The trait interacts with several database tables related to OpenAI functionality. Ensure your database schema includes these tables: `openai_chat_log`, `openai_chats`, `openai_question_translations`, `openai_langlines`, `openai_inputs`, `openai_languages`, and `openai_prompts`.
</Note>

<Warning>
- Direct database operations are used in some methods. Implement proper input validation and error handling in production environments.
- The trait assumes specific database structures. Ensure your database schema matches these assumptions.
- Some fields use CKEditor for rich text input. Ensure proper sanitization of this input to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait effectively:
1. Include it in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required properties, methods, and libraries are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Set up the necessary database tables and schemas.
4. Implement the OpenAI model (`$this->om`) with the required methods.
5. Customize the CRUD configurations (columns, filters, etc.) if needed to match your specific requirements.
6. Implement proper security measures, especially for admin-only accessible methods.
