title: 'Article_Entity_Content Trait'
description: 'Trait for handling entities with associated articles in a content management system'
---

The `Article_Entity_Content` trait provides functionality for managing entities that have associated articles. It defines a structure for displaying, filtering, and managing these entities.

## Main Method

### normals()

This method sets up the configuration for managing normal entities with associated articles.

Key actions:
1. Sets up group name and table type
2. Defines list and filter columns
3. Prepares select data for flags and colors
4. Defines input fields (columns) for the entity

## Configuration Properties

<ResponseField name="groupName" type="string" default="Articles">
  Defines the group name for these entities.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="typeOfTable" type="constant" default="TABLE_ENTITY_WITH_ARTICLE">
  Specifies the type of table. Options include:
  - TABLE_ENTITY_WITH_ARTICLE
  - TABLE_NOARTICLE_WITH_ALL_BUTTONS
  - TABLE_NOARTICLE_JUST_CLONE
</ResponseField>

## Columns and Filters

### listColumns

An array defining the columns to be displayed in the list view. Includes:
- name
- entities_tags_relation
- [table]_tags_relation
- id
- date_added

### filterColumns

An array defining the columns that can be used for filtering. Similar to listColumns but may include additional fields like 'description'.

## Input Fields

The method defines a set of input fields (columns) for the entity. Key fields include:

<ResponseField name="id" type="hidden">
  The unique identifier for the entity.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="date_added" type="hidden">
  The date the entity was added, automatically set to the current date and time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="text">
  The internal name of the entity.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="entities_tags_relation" type="m_n_relation">
  Manages the many-to-many relationship between entities and tags.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="[table]_tags_relation" type="m_n_relation">
  Manages the many-to-many relationship between the specific entity type and its tags.
</ResponseField>

## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to methods like `setTableName()`, `getSelector()`, `prepareTable()`, and properties like `bc` (likely a database crud object).
- It assumes the existence of a tags system and related database tables.
- The `normals()` method prepares the data and renders a view ('backend/crud/crud'), suggesting it's part of a larger CRUD system.

<Note>
The trait uses several properties (`entityTypeId`, `table`, `tableSingular`, `tablePrettyName`) that should be defined in the class using this trait.
</Note>

<Warning>
- The trait uses constants (`TABLE_ENTITY_WITH_ARTICLE`, etc.) which should be defined elsewhere in the application.
- The `prepareTable()` and `bc->execute()` methods are not defined in this trait and their functionality is crucial for the proper operation of the `normals()` method.
- This trait seems to be part of a larger system and may depend on other components not visible in this snippet.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait for a specific entity type:
1. Include the trait in your entity controller class.
2. Set the appropriate values for `table`, `tableSingular`, `tablePrettyName`, and `entityTypeId`.
3. Modify the `listColumns`, `filterColumns`, and `columns` arrays as needed for your specific entity type.
4. Ensure all required methods and properties are available in the using class or its parent classes.
