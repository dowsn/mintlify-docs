title: 'Noarticle_Entity_Content Trait'
description: 'Trait for managing entities without associated articles in a content management system'
---

The `Noarticle_Entity_Content` trait provides functionality for managing entities that don't have associated articles, such as artworks and searches.

## Main Methods

### artworks()

Manages the artworks entity.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Sets up CRUD operations for artworks
  - Defines list and filter columns
  - Configures input fields for artworks
</ResponseField>

### searches()

Manages the searches entity.

<ResponseField name="Key Features">
  - Sets up CRUD operations for searches
  - Defines list and filter columns including 'name', 'name_en', 'amount', and 'selector'
  - Configures input fields for searches, including a selector option
</ResponseField>

## Common Properties

<ResponseField name="groupName" type="string" default="Tables">
  Defines the group name for these entities in the CMS.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="typeOfTable" type="string" default="">
  Specifies the type of table (left empty in this trait).
</ResponseField>

## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to CodeIgniter's features and a custom CRUD library (`besc_crud`).
- It assumes the existence of several methods like `setTableName()`, `prepareTable()`, etc.
- The trait uses a pagination system, which should be set up in the parent class.

<Note>
The trait contains a commented-out method `normals()` which seems to be a template for creating new entity types. This method could be uncommented and customized for new entity types if needed.
</Note>

<Warning>
- The trait assumes specific database structures for artworks and searches. Ensure your database schema matches these assumptions.
- The commented-out `normals()` method contains complex logic for handling entities with articles. If uncommenting and using this method, thoroughly review and test its functionality.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait effectively:
1. Include it in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required properties, methods, and libraries are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Adjust the CRUD configurations (columns, filters, etc.) to match your specific requirements for each entity type.
4. If creating new entity types, consider using the commented `normals()` method as a template, customizing it as needed.
5. Implement proper error handling and input validation, especially for database operations.

## Key Components

### For Artworks
- Simple name field

### For Searches
- Name field (in default language)
- Name field in English
- Amount field
- Selector field (Yes/No option)

Each entity type uses CRUD operations to allow easy management through an admin interface.
