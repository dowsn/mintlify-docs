## Usage Notes

- This trait is designed to be used within a class that has access to methods like `setTableName()`, `getSelector()`, `prepareTable()`, and properties like `bc` (likely a database crud object).
- It assumes the existence of a file tag system and related database tables.
- The trait includes methods for file upload handling, including specific methods for images and PDFs.
- Image uploads include a resize function to limit dimensions to 1000x1000 pixels.

<Note>
The trait uses several properties and methods (`pagination`, `prepareTable()`, `bc->execute()`) that should be defined in the class using this trait.
</Note>

<Warning>
- The file upload methods don't include extensive security checks. Ensure proper validation and sanitization are implemented when using these methods.
- The trait uses helper functions (`rand_string()`, `resize_max()`) which are not defined within the trait and must be available in the application.
- Hardcoded paths and URL structures are used in upload methods, which may need adjustment based on the specific application structure.
</Warning>

## Customization

To use this trait for file management:
1. Include the trait in your content management class.
2. Ensure all required methods and properties are available in the using class or its parent classes.
3. Adjust file paths and URL structures as needed for your specific application setup.
4. Implement any additional security measures for file uploads as required by your application's security policy.
