## Project Structure

The Lecker project follows a specific file structure:

- `application/`
  - `config/` - Database connection, base URL, constants, routes, autoload, etc.
  - `controllers/` - Main project functions for frontend, backend, content management, etc.
  - `core/` - Contains MY_Controller with shared functions
  - `helpers/` - Contains besc_helper for simple helper functions
  - `language/` - Contains language lines accessed via `$this->lang->line('your_line_key')`
  - `libraries/` - Project libraries and Lecker_crud
  - `models/` - Models named by the controller where they are used
  - `views/` - HTML views for frontend, mail, authentication etc.
- `assets/` - Fixed assets shared between projects
- `system/` - Core CodeIgniter libraries and PHP files, including Model.php
- `items/` - Project-specific assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, uploads)
- `vendor/` - Composer and third-party libraries
- `composer.json` & `composer.lock` - List of installed libraries
- `index.php` - Application entry point (switch to production environment for live sites)
- `.htaccess`

## Core Components

### Controllers

1. Backend & Repository Controller
   - Basic backend functions
   - Repository management (overviews, teaser image selectors)

2. Content Controller
   - Setup of editable tables in CMS
   - Content Helper for displaying buttons and data
   - Module saving, cloning, and display
   - Error logging

3. Authentication & User Controller
   - Backend and frontend login
   - Password reset

4. Frontend Controller
   - Public-facing views
   - Data preparation

5. Lecker Controller
   - Core of the CRUD system
   - Functions for rendering tables, editing, filtering, and image upload

6. MY_Controller
   - Universal functions used throughout the app
   - Image preparation for modules
   - Naming functions
   - Error logging functions

### Models

Models specify database queries for CRUD operations using CodeIgniter syntax. The `Model.php` in the system folder defines universal model functions that can be used anywhere.

## Lecker CMS UI

The Content Management System is accessible via the Backend at `/backend` (default setting editable in routes.php). Key features include:

- Dashboard with editable tables
- Menu divided into groups:
  - Normal project user: Content, General, Repositories
  - Projects with shop: additional Shop category
  - Developers: additional Dev Area category
- Settings for user data and dashboard customization

<Note>
Login requires a backend_user with admin set to 1 to access and edit tables.

## Important Tables and Terms

1. Entity
   - Middle point to connect with teaser images and items
   - First image taken as main, can be reordered
   - Define table columns and relationships
   - Uses entity_teaser_relation
   - Types:
     - Article Entity: represented by a page with dynamic modules
     - Noarticle Entity: exist independently, without articles or modules
   - Must be specified in constants for ID generation

2. Article (table items)
   - Subordinate to Entity
   - Contains modules and language-specific content
   - Defined via pretty URL
   - Four visibility options:
     - Visible
     - Only with direct link
     - Logged in only
     - Hidden
   - Can be associated with multiple modules (text, image, gallery)
   - Supports multiple languages (specify in constants)
   - Can link original article with secondary language articles

3. Image Repository
   - Central storage for images and photos
   - Connect to entities as teaser images, modules, or noarticle entities
   - Public/private settings (private images blurred in backend)
   - Resized and saved by default in three versions using Imagick library:
     - Frontend image
     - Full size
     - Thumbnail

4. Tags
   - General (associated with any Article Entity)
   - Specific to certain Noarticle or Article entity types
   - Default tag connected with Normal Article entity

5. File Repository
   - For saving various file types (mainly smaller PDF files or ZIP packages)
   - Used in articles via download module

6. User Table
   - Accessible only to superadmin
   - For creating and managing user accounts and permissions

7. Dev Area
   - Not visible for non-dev backend users
   - Contains error logs, article overview, debugging tables, and stats
   - Automatic error logging using MY_Controller functions

## Libraries

Lecker includes several libraries:

- PDF creator
- Shopping functions
- Picture creation
- CKEditor for text editing
- PHPMailer

## Modules

Modules for articles are specified in three main areas:

1. Content Controller
   - Types of modules and their columns

2. crud.php
   - Preview of modules in backend
   - Module editor
   - Icons

3. Frontend Controller
   - Detail function to collect article-specific modules and content

4. JavaScript files
   - edit.js in items/backend
   - Module-specific JavaScript files
   - Specifies transfer of information between module editor and preview

## Security Best Practices

1. Keep the CMS and plugins up to date
2. Implement basic security measures
3. Use secrets management:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory - see template under installation
   - Access secrets using `$_ENV['SECRET_NAME']`
   - Use phpdotenv library
